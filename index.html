<br>

<h2> Hey. My name is kelz and welcome to my not bad at all website. You're probably wondering why you stumbled across a 2010 PHP-styled website that has no actual CSS at all, and you're wondering the right thing, because that's exactly what this is. It's currently 3am at the time of writing this and since I don't feel like dedicating the time to sitting down and actually making a website this early, this is all you will get for now. Enjoy. </h2>

<br> <br> 

<h3> This website really has no purpose (which is why I didn't put any effort into making a site) other than explaining <a href="https://devkelz.github.io/what-i-do.html/">what I do</a> and storing other projects which you can find open sourced on the Github.(linked at the top of the page) </h3>
